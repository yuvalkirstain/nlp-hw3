Hey Roi, we will use this repo for the exercise. Please git clone this repo, perform a sanity check that the code runs ok. We will submit from a path that you will provide so it's important that you notify me that you have done so. Please commit your work also so I'll perform a sanity check on it. If you have trouble with something, let me know.
